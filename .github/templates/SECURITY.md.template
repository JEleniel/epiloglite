# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of these channels:

- Use GitHub's security advisory feature: [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/security/advisories/new)
- For critical issues, you can encrypt your report using our [security team's PGP key](https://github.com/{username}.gpg)

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any known mitigations
- Any related references or CVEs

### What to Expect

When you submit a vulnerability report, our team will:

1. Confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. Provide a detailed response within 7 days
3. Keep you informed about our progress
4. Credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

> **Note:** Replace `{username}` and `{repo}` in links with your GitHub username and repository name when using this template.

If you find a security issue, please report it responsibly. Do not open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

- Use GitHub security advisories or contact maintainers privately.
- Include clear reproduction steps, impact, and possible mitigations.

Maintain a record of response expectations and crediting policy in a separate SECURITY.md in the repo root.
