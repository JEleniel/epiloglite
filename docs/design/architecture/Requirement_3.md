# Performance and Optimization

## Overview

EpilogLite must provide high-performance database operations through indexing, query optimization, and efficient memory management to handle production workloads effectively.

## User Story

As an application developer, I need my database operations to execute quickly and efficiently so that my application can handle high volumes of data and concurrent users without performance degradation.

## Features

### 1. Indexing System
- B-tree based indexes
- Primary key indexes (automatic)
- Unique indexes
- Regular (non-unique) indexes
- Composite indexes (multiple columns)
- Index creation and management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Indexes improve query performance measurably
- Primary key lookups use O(log n) time
- Unique constraint violations detected via indexes
- CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX work correctly
- Composite indexes optimize multi-column queries

### 2. Query Optimizer
- Cost-based optimization
- Index selection for WHERE clauses
- Join order optimization
- Query plan generation
- Statistics collection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Optimizer chooses indexes when beneficial
- Join order minimizes intermediate result sizes
- Query execution plans are generated
- Statistics-based decisions improve performance
- EXPLAIN shows query execution plans

### 3. Memory Management
- Configurable page cache size
- LRU-based cache eviction
- Memory pool for common allocations
- Buffer management
- Memory usage limits

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Page cache hit rate exceeds 90% for typical workloads
- Memory usage stays within configured limits
- Cache eviction doesn't cause thrashing
- No memory leaks under continuous operation
- Memory usage scales appropriately with data size

### 4. Disk I/O Optimization
- Write-ahead logging (WAL) mode
- Batch writes to reduce I/O
- Asynchronous I/O (planned)
- Read-ahead for sequential scans
- Checkpoint management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WAL improves write performance
- Batch operations minimize disk sync operations
- Sequential scans utilize read-ahead
- Checkpoint doesn't block normal operations
- Recovery from WAL is reliable

### 5. Concurrency
- Multi-threaded access (planned)
- Reader-writer locks
- MVCC for snapshot isolation (planned)
- Lock-free data structures where appropriate
- Deadlock prevention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple readers don't block each other
- Writers don't starve readers
- No data corruption under concurrent access
- Deadlocks prevented or detected
- Transaction isolation maintained
