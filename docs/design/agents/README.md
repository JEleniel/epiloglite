# Agent Documentation Directory

This directory contains documentation specifically for AI agents and automated tools working on the EpilogLite project.

## Quick Start for Agents

**Start here**: Read these documents in order:

1. **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Current implementation state overview
2. **[CODE_REVIEW_2024.md](CODE_REVIEW_2024.md)** - Latest code quality review (December 2024)
3. **[TODO.md](TODO.md)** - Prioritized task list and roadmap
4. **[SUBQUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md](SUBQUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md)** - Specific optimization guidance

## Document Index

### IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
**Purpose**: High-level overview of current implementation  
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Contents**:
- Architecture overview
- Module status (complete/in-progress/planned)
- Test coverage statistics
- Feature completeness
- Known limitations

**Read this first** to understand what's implemented and what's not.

### CODE_REVIEW_2024.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive code quality review and analysis  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Contents**:
- Critical issues fixed (compilation errors, test failures)
- Code quality analysis (92 clippy warnings)
- Unimplemented features detailed analysis
- Security considerations
- Recommendations for improvements

**Read this** to understand code quality status and priorities.

### TODO.md
**Purpose**: Phased development plan and task prioritization  
**Last Updated**: Ongoing  
**Contents**:
- Current phase tasks
- Planned phases
- Feature-by-feature checklist
- Test coverage targets
- Progress tracking

**Use this** to pick tasks and track progress.

### SUBQUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md
**Purpose**: Technical guidance on subquery implementation  
**Contents**:
- Optimization strategies
- Implementation approaches
- Performance considerations

**Reference this** when working on query optimization.

## Current Project Status

**As of December 2024**:
- ✅ **Compilation**: Success (no errors)
- ✅ **Tests**: 289/289 passing (100%)
- ⚠️  **Code Quality**: 92 clippy warnings
- ⚠️  **Completion**: ~85% (core features complete)

**Grade**: B+ (Very Good - functional and tested, needs polish)

## Key Facts for Agents

### What Works Well
- SQL parsing (comprehensive support)
- CRUD operations (full implementation)
- Transactions (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK/SAVEPOINT)
- Persistence (disk I/O, caching)
- Query builder (fluent API)
- Permissions/RBAC (basic implementation)
- Tests (100% pass rate)

### What Needs Work
- Virtual machine (opcodes not implemented)
- Code generator (stub only)
- Graph storage (parser done, execution stub)
- Stored procedures (framework only)
- Server mode (stubs/placeholders)
- Code quality (clippy warnings)

### What's Not Started
- No-std mode
- Extended Unicode 16
- Advanced JOIN types (FULL OUTER, CROSS)
- CTEs and window functions

## Development Workflow

When working on EpilogLite:

1. ✅ Read IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
2. ✅ Read CODE_REVIEW_2024.md
3. ✅ Check TODO.md for tasks
4. ✅ Run tests: `cargo test`
5. ✅ Check code: `cargo clippy`
6. ✅ Make changes
7. ✅ Test changes: `cargo test`
8. ✅ Update documentation
9. ✅ Commit with clear messages

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Check compilation
cargo check

# Lint code
cargo clippy

# Format code
cargo fmt
```

## Code Quality Standards

- **Safety**: 100% safe Rust (except optional capi module)
- **Tests**: All features must have tests
- **Documentation**: Public APIs must have doc comments
- **Style**: Follow Rust conventions (tabs, not spaces)
- **Errors**: Use Result types, no panics in library code

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't break forbid(unsafe_code)** - Project is 100% safe Rust
2. **Test before committing** - All tests must pass
3. **Update docs** - Keep IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md current
4. **Check clippy** - Address warnings when possible
5. **Minimal changes** - Don't refactor unnecessarily

## Architecture Notes

EpilogLite follows a modular architecture:

```
SQL Text → Tokenizer → Parser → Processor → Storage → Disk
                                   ↓
                              Virtual Machine (partial)
                                   ↓
                              Code Generator (stub)
```

Key principles:
- Separation of concerns
- Type-safe APIs
- Result-based error handling
- Immutable data where possible
- Zero-copy optimizations

## Performance Considerations

When making changes:
- Consider cache locality
- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Use `&[u8]` instead of `&Vec<u8>`
- Prefer `iter()` over cloning
- Profile before optimizing

## Security Considerations

When adding features:
- Validate all inputs
- Check for SQL injection vectors
- Implement bounds checking
- Add adversarial tests
- Consider DoS potential

## Getting Help

If you need clarification:
1. Read the relevant design document in `/docs/design/`
2. Check existing code for patterns
3. Look at tests for examples
4. Review CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines

## Updating This Directory

When updating these documents:
- Keep IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md current with module status
- Update TODO.md as tasks complete
- Add new reviews as CODE_REVIEW_YYYY.md
- Reference new documents from README.md
