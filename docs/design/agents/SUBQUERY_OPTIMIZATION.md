# Phase 29: Subquery Optimization Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of subquery optimization features for EpilogLite as part of Phase 29.

## Completion Date

2024-12-XX

## Features Implemented

### 1. Subquery Flattening

Implemented rule-based subquery flattening based on optimization guidelines from QUERYPLANNER.md:

-	`can_flatten_subquery()` - Checks if a subquery meets criteria for flattening
-	`flatten_subquery()` - Performs subquery flattening transformation
-	Rules implemented:
	-	Check for DISTINCT conflicts
	-	Check for aggregate conflicts
	-	Handle correlated vs. non-correlated subqueries
	-	Correlation reference complexity checks

### 2. Correlated Subquery Support

Implemented optimization strategies for correlated subqueries:

-	`optimize_correlated_subquery()` - Optimizes correlated subquery execution
-	Single correlation: Converts to semi-join when possible
-	Multiple correlations: Uses per-row execution with caching
-	Cost estimation includes cache hit rate assumptions

### 3. IN Subquery Optimization

Implemented efficient IN subquery processing:

-	`optimize_in_subquery()` - Optimizes IN (SELECT ...) patterns
-	Small result sets (<50 rows): Uses direct comparison
-	Large result sets (â‰¥50 rows): Uses hash table lookup
-	Adaptive strategy based on estimated cardinality

### 4. EXISTS Optimization

Implemented short-circuit evaluation for EXISTS:

-	`optimize_exists_subquery()` - Optimizes EXISTS checks
-	Stops after finding first matching row
-	Cost is ~10% of full scan
-	Includes early termination for WHERE filters

### 5. Subquery Caching

Implemented result caching for subqueries:

-	`cache_subquery_result()` - Stores subquery results
-	`get_cached_subquery()` - Retrieves cached results with hit tracking
-	`clear_subquery_cache()` - Clears all cached results
-	`get_cache_stats()` - Returns cache statistics (entries, hits)
-	Prevents redundant subquery execution

### 6. Supporting Data Structures

Added new types to support subquery optimization:

-	`SubqueryType` enum - Scalar, In, Exists, Correlated
-	`SubqueryInfo` struct - Metadata about a subquery
-	`CachedSubqueryResult` struct - Cached results with hit counter
-	Extended `QueryOptimizer` with subquery_cache field

## Code Location

All code is in: `src/eplite/optimizer.rs`

## Test Coverage

Added 11 comprehensive unit tests:

1.	`test_subquery_flattening_simple` - Basic flattening
2.	`test_subquery_flattening_correlated` - Correlated subquery flattening
3.	`test_subquery_flattening_blocked_by_aggregate` - Flattening restrictions
4.	`test_in_subquery_optimization_small` - IN with small result sets
5.	`test_in_subquery_optimization_large` - IN with large result sets
6.	`test_exists_subquery_optimization` - EXISTS short-circuit
7.	`test_correlated_subquery_single_correlation` - Single correlation optimization
8.	`test_correlated_subquery_multiple_correlations` - Multiple correlation handling
9.	`test_subquery_caching` - Cache operations
10.	`test_subquery_cache_clear` - Cache clearing
11.	`test_subquery_cost_comparison` - Cost estimation validation

All tests pass successfully.

## Design Decisions

### Flattening Rules

Based on QUERYPLANNER.md, we implement conservative flattening rules:
-	Reject flattening when outer query has DISTINCT and subquery is correlated
-	Reject flattening when outer query has aggregates and subquery has correlations
-	Allow simple single-correlation flattening
-	Use `can_flatten` flag from analysis phase

### Cost Model

Cost estimation uses these principles:
-	Full scan cost: `row_count * avg_row_size`
-	Index scan cost: `log2(row_count) * 10`
-	JOIN cost: `outer_rows * inner_rows * 0.1`
-	EXISTS short-circuit: ~10% of full scan
-	Cache hit rate assumption: 50% for typical queries

### Caching Strategy

Simple but effective caching:
-	Key-based lookup using query string
-	No expiration policy (cleared per statement)
-	Hit count tracking for statistics
-	Suitable for repeated subquery execution in correlated scenarios

## Performance Impact

Expected performance improvements:
-	Subquery flattening: 2-10x speedup for flattenable queries
-	EXISTS optimization: ~10x speedup vs. full scan
-	IN optimization with hash: 2-5x speedup for large result sets
-	Correlated subquery caching: 2x speedup with 50% hit rate

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future releases:
-	More sophisticated flattening rules (compound queries, CTEs)
-	Adaptive cache eviction policies
-	Statistics-based cache sizing
-	Semi-join and anti-join transformations
-	Subquery result materialization decisions
-	Integration with query planner for automatic transformation
